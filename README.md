# privatevpn
This is a self hested vpn on a untuntu web server. Most normal Vpn providers ask for a premium for their services and you wont have no way of knowing that they wont sell your info to third parties. A self hosted vpn is cheaper and gives you the control of your datda. I've illustated the steps below on how to create your own private vpn and host it for free for the first 10 months.

# getting  a server
The first is getting a  web server to host your vpn, i've used the digital ocean starter ubuntu server which comes ad 5$/month, but you can sign up with your <a href="https://education.github.com/packgithub">student account</a> and get 50$ digital ocean credit and host it for free.
You can also use aws google webservices or any of other free cloud services to host it for free.

## For digital ocean

1. Go to create a droplet

select the lowest tier for 5$/month. Our vpn server doesnt require much resources so this should be more than enough to run it.

Now you'll get a mail in your digital ocean registered email id with the login initials for your ubuntu server.

It will look something like this.
